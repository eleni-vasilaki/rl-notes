    "## Optimisation and Decision Making  \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine how you make choices in your life. Implicit in your choices, there is some form of optimisation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you try, when possible, to go to the university of your choice, selecting a topic of study that you believe will be most beneficial—perhaps because of career opportunities, personal interest, financial stability, or social connections. Often, it is a combination of these factors. Different things matter to different people, but in the end, you are **implicitly optimising** your life.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you didn’t want to overthink everything, so you left part of the decision to chance. That means you optimised for something else—your energy, your well-being, your time. You chose to focus on something you value more, and you let luck determine the rest. That, too, is an implicit **optimisation**—choosing where to direct your effort.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, think about how you make choices in friendships. On this planet, there may be a person who could be your best friend, someone whose personality and experiences align with yours in ways you haven’t yet discovered. But you may never meet them. The best friends you will ever have might still be strangers to you at this moment. I can certainly tell you that in my twenties, I had not yet met the best friends I would ever have.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Or take romantic relationships, if that interests you. Even here, you are optimising something. Not everyone is optimising for the same thing—some people prioritise shared interests, others stability, others excitement. But almost everyone **optimises locally**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take dating or friendship as an example. Even if you search for connections online, thinking that you are broadening your options, your **search is still local**—it is constrained to the population that uses that particular platform, social media, or social environment you have chosen to engage with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While some people may feel they are making the **optimal** choices for their lives, in reality, our choices are wildly different because different things mean different benefits to each of us. And often, we make decisions under constraints. But one thing remains true: optimisation is at the heart of how we make choices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will discuss **gradient descent**, a popular optimisation method that looks for an optimal local solution. We will look at reinforcement learning within this framework—where what we are trying to optimise is **reward**. We will start with defining a system by a function of multiple parameters, which we want to maximise or minimise, and discuss how to do so using the concept of gradient."

    "## Convex Functions and Single Local Minima\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system described mathematically by a function $f(x_1, x_2,\\ldots, x_n)$. Such a function is known as **multivariable** because it accepts multiple variables as inputs simultaneously. A more compact way to describe it is by $f(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{x}=[x_1~x_2~x_3 \\ldots]^T$ is a vector representing the parameters of the system. $T$ here is the operator \"transposed,\" meaning rows become columns (and vice versa), as in mathematics, vectors are typically considered column vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of optimisation is to find the values of $\\mathbf{x}$ that either minimise or maximise $f(\\mathbf{x})$, depending on whether $f(\\mathbf{x})$ is a measure of error or performance. When the function has a single extremum, it is possible to find its minimum or maximum through analytical methods. For a given function $f(\\mathbf{x})$, direct minimisation involves calculating the values of $\\mathbf{x}$ that lead to the lowest value of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, a **strictly convex function** $f(\\mathbf{x})$, such as $f(\\mathbf{x})=x_1^2+x_2^2$, has at most one global minimum. To locate critical points, we take the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to each parameter $x_i$ and set it to zero:\n",

However, this alone does not guarantee a minimum—it could also be a maximum, or a saddle point, see explanation below. The key fact is that if $f(\\mathbf{x})$ is strictly convex, then any critical point must be a **global minimum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saddle points\n",
    "A saddle point is a point where the gradient is zero, meaning there is no immediate direction of steepest descent or ascent. However, unlike a local minimum or maximum, the curvature of the function behaves differently in different directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On one side, moving away from the saddle point causes the function to increase.  \n",
    "- On another side, moving away from the saddle point causes the function to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the point is not a true minimum or maximum, but rather a transition point where the function “curves up” in some directions and “curves down” in others. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Convexity\n",
    "\n",
    "A function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is **convex** if, for all points $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and for all $\\theta \\in [0,1]$, it satisfies the inequality:\n",

    "Intuitively, this property means that the line segment connecting any two points on the graph of $f$ lies entirely above or on the graph itself. Consequently, any local minimum is also a global minimum—a property particularly beneficial in optimisation problems.\n",

    "A function is **strictly convex** if the inequality above is strict:\n",

    "# Multiple local minima. Introduction to Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "For more complex systems, finding parameters that minimise the error function by simply setting the derivative to zero is generally not effective. Complex systems often have multiple local minima (or maxima) and complex interdependencies between parameters. To circumvent this issue, we use a method called **gradient descent**. Starting from an initial point, we estimate the gradient of the error function and take a small step in the opposite direction of this gradient. This is because the gradient of a function at any point gives us the direction of the steepest ascent.\n",
    "\n",
    "By moving in the opposite direction, we iteratively follow the path of steepest descent, leading us towards a local minimum of the function. This technique is important for machine learning and many other optimisation algorithms. The process can be mathematically represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{x}_i - \\eta \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}), $$\n",

The learning rate $\\eta$ controls the size of the steps we take towards the minimum. The gradient $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2},\\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n} \\right]$$\n",

    "which contains information about the partial derivatives of the function.\n",

    "Traditionally, gradients are expressed as **column vectors** in mathematics and deep learning literature. However, tools like PyTorch store gradients as row vectors. It is important to choose a convention and use it consistently throughout calculations and implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **update rule** is typically written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\Delta \\mathbf{x} = - \\eta \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}), $$\n",

    "This tells us how much $f(x)$ increases for a small increase in $x$. For multivariable functions, this concept extends to the **gradient** $\\nabla f$, which we defined earlier as the vector of partial derivatives. Each component of $\\nabla f$ indicates how $f$ changes with respect to a small change in one input parameter, holding the others constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Move Opposite to the Gradient?\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient $\\nabla f$ points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function. To **minimise** $f(x)$, we move opposite to the gradient:\n",

    "### Issues with Gradient Descent\n",
    "Since the gradient descent method finds only a local solution, several related challenges arise when applying it to complex problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Getting Stuck in Local Minima**  \n",
    "In non-convex landscapes, gradient descent typically converges to a local minimum instead of the global minimum. Since it follows the path of steepest descent, it cannot escape a local minimum once reached.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Slow Convergence in Flat Regions**  \n",
    "Some functions contain flat regions where the gradient is close to zero: $ \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx 0$. When the algorithm enters such a region, updates become small, slowing progress.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Saddle Points**  \n",
    "A saddle point is a stationary point where the gradient is zero, but the function has both increasing and decreasing directions. Gradient descent struggles to escape saddle points because the gradient is small.     \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Poor Scaling of Gradients**  \n",
    "If gradients vary significantly across dimensions, updates may be too large in some directions and too small in others.  This leads to slow or unstable convergence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sensitivity to Learning Rate**  \n",
    "A learning rate ($\\eta$) that is too high can cause the algorithm to oscillate around the minimum. If $\\eta$ is too small, convergence is slow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques to Improve Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to the issues related to gradient descent, several techniques have been developed over the years. Below, you may find a few typical techniques used particularly in the context of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting from Different Initial Points**  \n",
    "Running gradient descent from multiple initialisations increases the chance of finding a better minimum.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Momentum**  \n",
    "Momentum helps smooth updates by incorporating past gradients, helping to escape shallow local minima and speeding up convergence. A formulation of momentum is shown below; $\\beta$ is a tunable parameter that controls how much of the past gradient is retained, and $\\eta$ is the learning rate.\n",

    "$$  \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adaptive Learning Rates**  \n",
    "Methods like **AdaGrad, RMSprop, and Adam** adjust the learning rate dynamically to prevent updates from becoming too large or too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gradient Clipping**  \n",
    "If gradients become too large, enforcing an upper bound $C$ helps stabilise training:\n",

    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Learning Rate Decay**  \n",
    "Gradually reducing $\\eta$ over time allows finer updates as convergence nears. A common schedule is shown below; $\\eta_0$ is the initial learning rate, $k$ is the decay factor, and $t$ is the iteration index:  \n",

    "## Policies and the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're navigating the diverse culinary landscape of a new city. After several dining experiences, you discover a restaurant that exceeds all expectations. Now, you face a classic decision: to explore further or to exploit this find. Exploring entails the risk of less satisfying meals, while exploiting ensures enjoyment but may preclude the discovery of superior options. This scenario illustrates the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning, where agents must balance the pursuit of known rewards against the potential of discovering greater rewards through exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, the probability by which an agent chooses their actions is known as a **policy**. Several policies exist, that navigate the exploration-exploitation dilemma in different ways. Here, we will present fixed policies, and discuss their benefits and drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Greedy Policy**: This policy always selects the action with the highest estimated reward based on current knowledge. It is formally expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$a_n = \\underset{a}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\ Q(a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here, $\\underset{a}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\ Q(a)$ returns the action $a$ that maximizes the current estimated reward. While the greedy policy maximizes immediate rewards, it may overlook potentially higher rewards from less-explored actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimistic Greedy Policy**: An optimistic initialization encourages exploration by starting with a high initial estimate for all actions. The action selection mechanism is the same as the greedy policy, but the initial optimism motivates exploration early on. This can be represented by initializing $Q(a)$ to a value higher than any expected reward, promoting exploration of all actions before converging to exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epsilon-Greedy Policy**: This policy introduces a probability $\\epsilon$ to explore random actions, allowing the agent to intermittently diverge from the greedy choice. It can be mathematically described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$a_n = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "  \\text{a random action} & \\text{with probability } \\epsilon \\\\\n",
    "  \\underset{a}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\ Q(a) & \\text{with probability } 1 - \\epsilon\n",
    "  \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this context, $\\text{a random action}$ with probability $\\epsilon$ allows for exploration, and $\\underset{a}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\ Q(a)$ with probability $1 - \\epsilon$ chooses the action believed to offer the highest reward, thus balancing exploration and exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Softmax Policy**: Unlike the aforementioned policies that make decisions based on a deterministic or semi-random criterion, the Softmax policy selects actions based on a probability distribution over the estimated rewards. The probability of selecting action $a$ at trial $n$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$P(a) = \\frac{e^{Q(a)/\\tau}}{\\sum_{b} e^{Q(b)/\\tau}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  where $\\tau$ is a temperature parameter that modulates the degree of exploration: a high $\\tau$ results in more exploratory behavior, while a low $\\tau$ makes the policy behave more greedily. This policy elegantly balances exploration and exploitation by probabilistically favoring actions with higher expected rewards but still allowing for exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "These policies represent distinct approaches to navigating the exploration-exploitation trade-off. The **Greedy Policy** prioritizes known rewards, potentially at the cost of missing out on better options. The **Optimistic Greedy Policy** mitigates this by fostering initial exploration through optimistic value estimates. The **Epsilon-Greedy Policy** offers a compromise, allowing for controlled exploration while primarily focusing on exploiting known information. The **Softmax Policy** provides a probabilistic method for action selection, smoothly transitioning between exploration and exploitation based on the temperature parameter $\\tau$.\n",

    "Now that we have defined rewards, action-value estimates, and policies, we can fully describe the multi-armed bandit problem, which is essentially a decision-making problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment**:  \n",
    "   - In the multi-armed bandit problem the environment consists of a single state.  \n",
    "   - The environment consists of multiple actions, e.g. **10 actions** $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$, each associated with a reward probability distribution.  \n",
    "   - The true expected reward $q^*(a)$ for each action $a$ is unknown to the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent**:  \n",
    "   - The agent interacts with the environment by selecting actions over a series of trials.  \n",
    "   - The agent's knowledge about the environment is encapsulated in its policy $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Policy ($\\pi$)**:  \n",
    "   - A policy $\\pi$ determines how the agent selects actions based on past observations and rewards.  \n",
    "   - The policy can be **deterministic** or **stochastic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:  \n",
    "   - Initialize the estimate of action-value $Q(a)$ for all $a$.  \n",
    "   - Initialize the count $N(a)$ of times each action has been selected to $0$.  \n",
    "   - Set N to the total number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For n = 1 to N, do**:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Policy Decision**: \n",
    "       Based on the current action-value estimates $Q(a)$, select an action $a$ using policy $\\pi$ (e.g. Epsilon-Greedy).  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Action and Reward**: Take action $a$, and observe reward $R_n$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Increase counter**:  \n",
    "      $$ N(a) = N(a) + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Update Action-Value Estimates**:  \n",
    "      For **stationary environments**:  \n",
    "      $$ Q(a) = Q(a) + \\frac{1}{N(a)}(R_n - Q(a)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optional bookkeeping for proofs/plots/code**:\n",
    "   - If you store the full trajectory, denote it as $Q_n(a)$, or in code as an array like `Q_history[n, a]`.\n",
    "   - This indexed form is for tracking evolution; the update rule itself is still written on the current value $Q(a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the algorithm is to maximize the cumulative expected reward over trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Stationary Environments\n",

    "The algorithm above can be adjusted by modifying the update rule as:  \n",
    "$$ Q(a) = Q(a) + \\eta (R_n - Q(a)) $$\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is a fixed step size (learning rate), ensuring that past rewards do not dominate future updates. A decaying learning rate can help mitigate instability and improve adaptability in non-stationary environments, as discussed earlier.\n"

    "# Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore bandits where rewards follow a binomial distribution, and where rare rewards are more valuable than common ones. Such conditions can lead agents to prematurely favor certain arms, being \"trapped\" in what is perceived as the best option based on incomplete information. Adjusting the policy becomes crucial to train an effective agent in these environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code snippet (below) outlines a basic framework for a 10-arm bandit problem, in a stationary environment. Executing this code will reveal the expected rewards for each arm. Key (hyper-)parameters for exploration include the learning rate, which indicates the rate at which $Q$ estimates are updated; epsilon, determining the balance between exploration and exploitation for the Epsilon-Greedy; and the temperature parameter for the Softmax policy, which adjusts the degree of exploration based on the reward distribution. By hyper-parameters, we refer to parameters that do not directly change as a consequence of the algorithmic updates, but you can set them and they affect the learning; to distinguish them from the \"learnable\" parameters, those that are adapted by the algorithm, in our case, the $Q$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the intentional gaps left for you to fill in, such as policy implementations and the agent update rule. The `np.random.choice` function will be instrumental in implementing the softmax policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code follows the OOP pattern from the primer (Notebook 0, Section 6): the environment is a class (`BanditProblem`), the learner is a class (`BanditAgent`) that stores and updates $Q$, and each policy is a lightweight class with a `select_action(Q)` method. The agent receives its policy via composition (`self.policy = policy`), so policies can be swapped without rewriting the agent. The simulation loop is a standalone function — it has no state of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "After filling in the gaps, try different parameters to deepen your understanding of exploration/exploitation, noise, and learning rate, and confirm the concepts we discussed previously. A large part in such models is tuning, selecting the hyper-parameters appropriately to obtain good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also enhance the policies, particularly the Epsilon-Greedy and Softmax strategies, as well as the learning rate scheme by heuristics. You could expand the implementation to also return cumulative average reward, so your graphs will be smoother, and you may need to average across fewer episodes, or remove the need for additional smoothing. We will not provide those in the solution and leave it to you to devise and implement.\n"
